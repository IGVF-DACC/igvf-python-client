## Example

```python
from igvf_client.models.search_result_item import SearchResultItem

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of SearchResultItem from a JSON string
search_result_item_instance = SearchResultItem.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(SearchResultItem.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
search_result_item_dict = search_result_item_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of SearchResultItem from a dict
search_result_item_from_dict = SearchResultItem.from_dict(search_result_item_dict)
