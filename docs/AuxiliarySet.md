# AuxiliarySet

Auxiliary set is a file set that hosts raw data files (e.g. FASTQs) resulting from sequencing of nucleic acids of a sample that are a proxy to some vital information and necessary for the analysis of an associated measurement set. Auxiliary sets usually would not provide any information about the transcriptome or the genome of the sample in question. For example auxiliary sets would include the sequencing of barcodes that correspond to the elements introduced into cells, or sequencing of guide RNA coding sequences in the cells. The files hosted in the auxiliary sets are relevant for the analysis, but they by themselves are not assessing much of the biology of the sample being analyzed.

## Example

```python
from igvf_client.models.auxiliary_set import AuxiliarySet

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of AuxiliarySet from a JSON string
auxiliary_set_instance = AuxiliarySet.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(AuxiliarySet.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
auxiliary_set_dict = auxiliary_set_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of AuxiliarySet from a dict
auxiliary_set_from_dict = AuxiliarySet.from_dict(auxiliary_set_dict)
