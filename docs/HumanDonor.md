```python
from igvf_client.models.human_donor import HumanDonor

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of HumanDonor from a JSON string
human_donor_instance = HumanDonor.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(HumanDonor.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
human_donor_dict = human_donor_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of HumanDonor from a dict
human_donor_from_dict = HumanDonor.from_dict(human_donor_dict)
