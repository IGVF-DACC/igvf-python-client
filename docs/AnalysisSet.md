# AnalysisSet

A file set for analyses. Analysis sets represent the results of a computational analysis of raw genomic data or other analyses.

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**input_file_sets** | **List[str]** | The file set(s) required for this analysis. | [optional] 
**release_timestamp** | **str** | The date the object was released. | [optional] 
**publications** | **List[str]** | The publications associated with this object. | [optional] 
**publication_identifiers** | **List[str]** | The publication identifiers that provide more information about the object. | [optional] 
**documents** | **List[str]** | Documents that provide additional information (not data file). | [optional] 
**lab** | **str** | Lab associated with the submission. | [optional] 
**award** | **str** | Grant associated with the submission. | [optional] 
**accession** | **str** | A unique identifier to be used to reference the object prefixed with IGVF. | [optional] 
**alternate_accessions** | **List[str]** | Accessions previously assigned to objects that have been merged with this object. | [optional] 
**collections** | **List[str]** | Some samples are part of particular data collections. | [optional] 
**status** | **str** | The status of the metadata object. | [optional] 
**revoke_detail** | **str** | Explanation of why an object was transitioned to the revoked status. | [optional] 
**schema_version** | **str** | The version of the JSON schema that the server uses to validate the object. | [optional] 
**uuid** | **str** | The unique identifier associated with every object. | [optional] 
**notes** | **str** | DACC internal notes. | [optional] 
**aliases** | **List[str]** | Lab specific identifiers to reference an object. | [optional] 
**creation_timestamp** | **str** | The date the object was created. | [optional] 
**submitted_by** | **str** | The user who submitted the object. | [optional] 
**submitter_comment** | **str** | Additional information specified by the submitter to be displayed as a comment on the portal. | [optional] 
**description** | **str** | A plain text description of the object. | [optional] 
**dbxrefs** | **List[str]** | Identifiers from external resources that may have 1-to-1 or 1-to-many relationships with IGVF file sets. | [optional] 
**samples** | **List[str]** | The sample(s) associated with this file set. | [optional] 
**donors** | **List[str]** | The donors of the samples associated with this analysis set. | [optional] 
**file_set_type** | **str** | The level of this analysis set. An intermediate analysis cannot be interpreted on its own and is part of a principal analysis. A principal analysis is the core analysis for an experimental design, the results of which can be interpretable on their own. | [optional] 
**id** | **str** |  | [optional] 
**type** | **List[str]** |  | [optional] 
**summary** | **str** |  | [optional] 
**files** | **List[str]** | The files associated with this file set. | [optional] 
**control_for** | **List[str]** | The file sets for which this file set is a control. | [optional] 
**submitted_files_timestamp** | **str** | The timestamp the first file object in the file_set or associated auxiliary sets was created. | [optional] 
**input_file_set_for** | **List[str]** | The file sets that use this file set as an input. | [optional] 
**assay_titles** | **List[str]** | Title(s) of assays that produced data analyzed in the analysis set. | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from igvf_client.models.analysis_set import AnalysisSet

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of AnalysisSet from a JSON string
analysis_set_instance = AnalysisSet.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(AnalysisSet.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
analysis_set_dict = analysis_set_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of AnalysisSet from a dict
analysis_set_from_dict = AnalysisSet.from_dict(analysis_set_dict)
```
