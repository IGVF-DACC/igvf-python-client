## Example

```python
from igvf_client.models.phenotypic_feature import PhenotypicFeature

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of PhenotypicFeature from a JSON string
phenotypic_feature_instance = PhenotypicFeature.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(PhenotypicFeature.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
phenotypic_feature_dict = phenotypic_feature_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of PhenotypicFeature from a dict
phenotypic_feature_from_dict = PhenotypicFeature.from_dict(phenotypic_feature_dict)
