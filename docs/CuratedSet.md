## Example

```python
from igvf_client.models.curated_set import CuratedSet

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of CuratedSet from a JSON string
curated_set_instance = CuratedSet.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(CuratedSet.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
curated_set_dict = curated_set_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of CuratedSet from a dict
curated_set_from_dict = CuratedSet.from_dict(curated_set_dict)
```
