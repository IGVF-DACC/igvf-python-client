# MeasurementSet

Measurement set is a file set that hosts raw data files (e.g. FASTQs) resulting from sequencing of a library prepared from the nucleic acids of the sample that is the main target of the assay. For example sequencing of accessible regions in the genome, or sequencing of the transcriptome of the sample. The assay can either be bulk or single cell type. The sample specific raw sequencing results will be captured in the measurement sets. The files in the measurement sets are specific to the sample being investigated. See auxiliary sets for files that are not a direct result of sequencing the sample under investigation.

**description** | **str** | A plain text description of the object. | [optional] 
**dbxrefs** | **List[str]** | Identifiers from external resources that may have 1-to-1 or 1-to-many relationships with IGVF file sets. | [optional] 
**samples** | **List[str]** | The sample(s) associated with this file set. | [optional] 
**donors** | **List[str]** | The donors of the samples associated with this measurement set. | [optional] 
**file_set_type** | **str** | The category that best describes this measurement set. | [optional] 
**assay_term** | **str** | The assay used to produce data in this measurement set. | [optional] 
**library_construction_platform** | **str** | The platform used to construct the library sequenced in this measurement set. | [optional] 
**protocols** | **List[str]** | Links to the protocol(s) for conducting the assay on Protocols.io. | [optional] 
**preferred_assay_title** | **str** | The custom lab preferred label for the experiment performed in this measurement set. | [optional] 
**multiome_size** | **int** | The number of datasets included in the multiome experiment this measurement set is a part of. | [optional] 
**control_file_sets** | **List[str]** | File sets that can serve as scientific controls for this measurement_set. | [optional]

**external_image_url** | **str** | Links to the external site where images produced by this measurement are stored. | [optional] 
**targeted_genes** | **List[str]** | A list of genes targeted in this assay. For example, TF ChIP-seq attempts to identify binding sites of a protein encoded by a specific gene. In CRISPR FlowFISH, the modified samples are sorted based on expression of a specific gene. This property differs from small_scale_gene_list in Construct Library Set, which describes genes targeted by the content integrated in the constructs (such as guide RNAs.) | [optional]

## Example

```python
from igvf_client.models.measurement_set import MeasurementSet

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of MeasurementSet from a JSON string
measurement_set_instance = MeasurementSet.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(MeasurementSet.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
measurement_set_dict = measurement_set_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of MeasurementSet from a dict
measurement_set_from_dict = MeasurementSet.from_dict(measurement_set_dict)
