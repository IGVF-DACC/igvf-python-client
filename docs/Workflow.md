## Example

```python
from igvf_client.models.workflow import Workflow

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of Workflow from a JSON string
workflow_instance = Workflow.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(Workflow.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
workflow_dict = workflow_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of Workflow from a dict
workflow_from_dict = Workflow.from_dict(workflow_dict)
