# RodentDonor

A rodent donor of a biosample. Submission of any sample originating from a rodent donor requires submission of information about the relevant donor. The rodent donor can be a generic representative of an inbred strain, or a unique, individual mouse. For example, submission of a B6 mouse donor is a prerequisite for submission of any B6 mouse samples.

## Example

```python
from igvf_client.models.rodent_donor import RodentDonor

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of RodentDonor from a JSON string
rodent_donor_instance = RodentDonor.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(RodentDonor.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
rodent_donor_dict = rodent_donor_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of RodentDonor from a dict
rodent_donor_from_dict = RodentDonor.from_dict(rodent_donor_dict)
