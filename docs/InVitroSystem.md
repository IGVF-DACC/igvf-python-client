## Example

```python
from igvf_client.models.in_vitro_system import InVitroSystem

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of InVitroSystem from a JSON string
in_vitro_system_instance = InVitroSystem.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(InVitroSystem.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
in_vitro_system_dict = in_vitro_system_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of InVitroSystem from a dict
in_vitro_system_from_dict = InVitroSystem.from_dict(in_vitro_system_dict)
