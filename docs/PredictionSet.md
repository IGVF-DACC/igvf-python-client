# PredictionSet

A file set of computational predictions. Prediction sets contain results of analyses to predict functions or traits of genomic features.

## Example

```python
from igvf_client.models.prediction_set import PredictionSet

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of PredictionSet from a JSON string
prediction_set_instance = PredictionSet.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(PredictionSet.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
prediction_set_dict = prediction_set_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of PredictionSet from a dict
prediction_set_from_dict = PredictionSet.from_dict(prediction_set_dict)
```
